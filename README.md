Tempest is a unique progressive web application that lets users and governments predict the outcomes of natural disasters. Using web scraped data, we were able to predict where storms would end up causing most damage and create interactive visualizations to aid the process. 

We took a unique approach from the common hackathon project. Instead of creating an application meant for general use, we developed an application specifically for state and city governments. We plan to implement our software as part of a nationwide government plan to promote smarter disaster response and efficient planning. Instead of having a grassroots approach to helping the community, we believe using the governmentâ€™s platform is the best method of outsourcing our solution. Since governments often utilize outside developers to build applications, we believe our website fills a normally unoccupied niche, and projects like this should be encouraged in the hackathon community.
